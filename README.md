# Refactor & Extend: Simple Tool-Using Agent

**Goal:** Turn a brittle, partially working agent into production-quality code, then extend it with a new tool and real tests.

---
You must **refactor for robustness**, **add one new tool** (translator / unit converter), and **add proper tests**.
---

## Your Tasks (Summary)

1. **Refactor**
2. **Improve**
3. **Add ONE new tool** 
4. **Write tests**
5. **Improve Documentation**

See the assignment brief for full details (shared in the job post).

## Quick Start

### Python 3.10+ recommended

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run

```bash
python main.py "What is 12.5% of 243?"
python main.py "Summarize today's weather in Paris in 3 words"
python main.py "Who is Ada Lovelace?"
python main.py "Add 10 to the average temperature in Paris and London right now."
```

### Test

```bash
pytest -q
```

> Note: The fake LLM sometimes emits malformed JSON to simulate real-world flakiness.

## What we expect you to change

- Split responsibilities into modules/classes.
- Add a schema for tool plans; validate inputs and tool names.
- Make tool calls resilient and typed;
- Add one new tool and tests that prove your design is extensible.
- Update this README with an architecture diagram (ASCII ok) and clear instructions.
- You can use Real LLMs or a fake one, but ensure your code is robust against malformed responses.

Good luck & have fun!
